### Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Jon Currie, a proud entrepreneur and dedicated professional with a passion for both landscaping and law enforcement.

# From Landscaping to Law: A Journey of Purpose

Originally hailing from Havre, Montana, I discovered my love for the great outdoors and the artistry of landscaping at an early age. With a vision for transforming spaces and a drive for entrepreneurial success, I founded my own landscaping company, where for seven rewarding years, I had the privilege of bringing beauty and functionality to properties throughout our community.

Driven by a desire to broaden my impact and serve others in a different capacity, I made the leap into the field of law enforcement. Joining the esteemed teams at Lets Bail Bonds and Affordable Monitoring of Montana in Havre, I took on roles as a Surety Agent and Compliance Monitor. Specializing in criminal bail bonds and SCRAM monitoring, I worked tirelessly to assist clients facing various legal challenges, particularly those related to DUI charges.

# Commitment to Community and Justice

Throughout my career, whether tending to landscapes or navigating the complexities of the legal system, my guiding principles have remained the same: integrity, compassion, and a dedication to serving others. I believe deeply in the importance of giving back to my community and making a positive difference in the lives of those around me.
